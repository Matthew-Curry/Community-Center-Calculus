# Community-Center-Calculus
In a capstone Mathematics course at Lafayette College I was tasked with creating and presenting a model to optimize the Community Engagement Center's transportation schedule and to clearly present the model's results. To complete this project, I worked with a partner who was primarily responsible for developing the program, while my main task was to clearly write our results and define mathematically equations to describe how our program worked. This is the paper which I primarily wrote which I included to show my ability to convey technical information in writing.
